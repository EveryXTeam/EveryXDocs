### What is EveryX?

EveryX is a different kind of prediction market – built from the ground up to support built-in leverage and real-money trading on event probabilities. Users **trade on probabilities** of outcomes in sports, crypto, politics, weather, economics, markets, disasters and more\!

### What Makes EveryX Different

* **Clear stop-loss behavior-** users always know the maximum they can lose and positions are cut with zero slippage

* **No liquidity constraints-** with our trading pool logic, there is no need to match your order against other users – nor any market makers. That means your order flow *cannot* be picked off.

* **You control your risk-** feeling cautious? Dial down the leverage and choose a stop-level that you’re comfortable with. 

* **True predictions-** the traded value flowing into each event dictates the outcome’s probabilities. When users trade their convictions, the probabilities necessarily fall into line.

* **Multi-Outcome markets-** our system was built with choice in mind – no need to trade only on simple Yes/No outcomes.

* **Trades executed in an instant-** our order matching logic processes trades in sub millisecond speeds.

# Our Vision

### Time for EveryX to Shine

EveryX is built on the belief that markets can do more than trade stocks and coins. They can become a practical tool for insight – a way for communities, organizations, and individuals to see, in one number, what the crowd really thinks will happen. That’s the core idea behind a **prediction market**.

Prediction markets *should*:

* Inform business and policy decisions

* Guide how capital and attention are allocated

* Help groups coordinate around reality instead of noise

Today, they mostly don’t. They’re still niche tools, used by a small group of specialists and hobbyists.

Our goal is simple:

**Move prediction markets from curiosity to everyday infrastructure.**

### Why We Built EveryX

EveryX started from a simple question:

**If lots of people each know a little bit, how do we turn that into one good prediction?**

In real life, many different people hold pieces of information about the future — about elections, sports, crypto, inflation, technology and more.

No one sees everything, but **together** they often know a lot.

A prediction market is a way to collect that knowledge:

* Instead of filling in a survey, people **put money behind what they think will happen**.

* If they think an outcome is too cheap, they buy it.

* If they think it’s too expensive, they avoid it or trade the other side.

* When lots of people do this, the **probability on the screen becomes a crowd forecast**.

### What Makes EveryX Different

EveryX takes this idea and makes it practical and accessible:

* **Clear probabilities**  
  We show **simple**, easy-to-read probabilities instead of confusing share prices, so anyone can quickly see “what the market thinks”.

* **Leverage with a clear maximum loss**  
  Users can use **leverage** so that strong opinions matter even with small stakes – while always knowing the most they can lose.

* **Advanced pool-based algorithms**  
  We use **advanced algorithms** to manage the investment pools, so events can stay tradable even when there aren’t many buyers and sellers at the same moment.


#### *Put together, EveryX:*

Uses a **probability-first design** so anyone can understand what they’re seeing, then adds **built-in leverage** so capital can work harder, on top of a robust, barrier-free execution agent. The result- greater returns without complexity. 

**EveryX turns what many people know into live probabilities that anyone can see and trade on.**

### Opportunity Knocks

Prediction markets are getting more attention than ever, but they still haven’t become everyday infrastructure. Across most platforms, the same four problems keep showing up:

#### *Liquidity*

* Outside a few big events (like US elections), markets are often **thin and easy to move**.

* A single mid-sized order can swing displayed probabilities by a large amount, making prices unreliable.

* Many platforms struggle to keep users coming back, so markets “die” after the first wave of trades.

#### *Capital Inefficiency*

* On most platforms, users **lock funds until resolution** – which can take months or years.

* Payouts are capped between 0 and 1 with **no built-in leverage**, so capital works slowly.

* Users can’t easily spread the same capital across multiple outcomes and events; money sits idle.

#### *Poor User Experience*

* Platforms decide most of **what you can trade on**, and often keep 100% of fees.

* Interfaces are built around **order books and trading jargon** that many people don’t understand.

* There’s usually **no meaningful engagement loop** beyond placing a single trade.

#### *Expert Exodus*

* The people with the best information (domain experts, analysts, niche community leaders) **often don’t participate**.

* Markets feel illiquid or “rigged” by professional market makers.

* Returns are too low for the effort, and there’s no way to build a visible **track record of skill**.

*Result:*  
Prediction markets remain a **curiosity** instead of a **standard tool** for decision-making and insight.

### How EveryX Addresses These Challenges

EveryX is designed to tackle these problems directly, with a different architecture and product philosophy.

#### *Architecture: Crowd-priced pools, not fragile order books*

* EveryX uses real cash pools for each outcome instead of relying only on order books and market makers.

* Money can flow into one side of an event first (for example, “YES”), and the other side can arrive later.

* Probabilities are set by **everyone’s money combined**, not by a small group of professional market makers.

This makes it easier to keep **more events tradable**, including niche or long-tail topics that would struggle on a pure order-book system.

#### *Capital Efficiency: Leverage with clear limits*

* EveryX has **built-in leverage** so users can control larger positions while only risking a defined cash amount.

* **Stop-loss rules** cap the user’s maximum loss at their cash portion, while allowing meaningful upside if they are right.

* This lets capital work **harder and faster**, instead of sitting idle in low-return 0-to-1 positions.

Leverage on EveryX is a tool for **strong opinions and good information**, not just an advertising headline.

#### *User Experience: Probability-first, not trader-only*

* Users see **clear probabilities**, not confusing tickers or price ladders.

* Each trade is defined by three simple choices:

  * which outcome,

  * how much to risk,

  * and where to place the stop-loss.

* The interface is designed so that **non-experts** can understand what they’re doing, while experienced users still have control.

This lowers the barrier for new users and makes it easier for partners and KOLs to explain the product to their communities.

#### *Participation & Expertise: Fairer opponent, stronger signals*

* Because EveryX uses liquidity pools instead of a privileged market-maker desk, users are effectively trading against the **crowd**, not a hidden professional counterparty.

* Leverage plus clear risk limits make it worthwhile for **informed participants** to express their views, even with modest capital.

* Over time, EveryX can highlight **consistent performance and topic-specific skill**, turning expert insight into a visible asset.

This helps attract and retain the kind of participants who actually **improve** the forecasts.

#### *Overall Result*

EveryX will do what earlier prediction markets could not: **Turn markets on real-world events into a useful, repeatable tool – not just a curiosity.**

# Events and Outcomes

### What is an Event?

An **Event** is a real-world question that will eventually have a clear answer, for example:

* “Bitcoin to close above $100,000 on 31 Dec 2025?”

* “Team A to win the championship?”

* “Tokyo to experience an earthquake above X magnitude this year?”

Each Event has:

* A **start time** (when trading opens),

* An **end time** (when trading closes),

* A **resolution time** (when the outcome is known and payouts are made).

### Outcomes

Each Event offers two or more **Outcomes**, for example:

* YES / NO

* Team A / Team B / Draw

* Multiple time bands (e.g. “In March”, “In April”, etc.)

Outcomes are designed to be:

* **Clear**

* **Mutually exclusive** (only one can be correct)

* **Collectively exhaustive** (one of them must happen)

Users trade on **which Outcome they think will be correct**.

### How pricing works: crowd-priced outcome pools

EveryX does **not** use a traditional order book with bids and asks.

* Every Event has pools for each Outcome where user trades go.

* The **probability** shown on the screen is derived from how much money is in that outcome’s pool relative to the others.

Very simply:

**Probability of Outcome A ≈**  
**(Money in Pool A) ÷ (Money in Pool A \+ Pool B \+ Pool C \+ …)**

As more money flows into an Outcome:

* Its **probability goes up**,

* The probabilities of other Outcomes **go down**.

This means:

* You are effectively trading **against the entire crowd**, not a privileged market maker with deep pockets.

* Events can function without a 1:1 buyer and seller for every trade at the exact moment of entry.

### 

### Placing a trade

When a user trades on EveryX, they decide three main things:

1. **Which Event and Outcome** they want to trade.

2. **Trade size** (how much cash to risk).

3. **Leverage** and **stop-loss level** (how aggressively to amplify the position, and where to cut losses).

The interface focuses on **probability**, not prices:

* Users see the current **probability (%)** of each Outcome.

* They choose how much to risk and whether to use **leverage**.

* They set a **stop-loss probability** for their position.

When the Event resolves:

* If the user picked the **correct Outcome**, they receive a **payout from the losers**.

* If the user picked the **wrong Outcome**, they lose the **cash portion** they put at risk (or less, if they closed early). 

# Leverage: bigger positions with limited loss

### What is leverage on EveryX?

**Leverage** lets users control a **larger position** in an Outcome while only risking a smaller amount of their own cash (the “cash portion”).

* Maximum leverage is **10x** for now (this can change over time).

* Users always know their **maximum loss**: the cash portion of their trade.

Example (just to illustrate the idea):

* You risk **$50** of your own money with **10x leverage**.

* The system gives you **$500 worth of exposure** to that Outcome.

* If the market moves against you and hits your **stop-loss**, your position closes and your loss is capped to the **$50 cash** you put in.

No interest is charged on the “borrowed” portion of a leveraged trade.

### The stop-loss

Every leveraged position has a **stop-loss**, expressed as a **probability level**:

* When choosing leverage levels, you’ll see the associated **stop probability** before opening the trade.

* If the Outcome’s probability **falls to or below** that level, the system **automatically closes** your position.

* This protects you from losing more than your cash portion.

You can:

* Use a stop that is **closer** (higher potential returns, but more likely to be hit), or

* Set it **further away** (lower potential returns, but less likely to be hit).

You can also **add margin** later to reduce leverage and move the stop further away from the current probability.

# Risk management and limits

EveryX has multiple layers of risk control

### User-level risk

* **Max loss \= cash portion** of the trade.

* **Stop-loss** closes positions before losses exceed that cash portion.

* Users can set **stop warnings** to get alerts when their position is close to being stopped-out, giving them a chance to add margin to move the stop further away.

### Event-level risk

Each Event can have:

* **Maximum leverage** settings per Outcome.

* Limits based on how much **cash is in the Event overall**.

* Rules to limit **market impact** so one very large trade doesn’t destabilize prices.

These settings can differ between Events (e.g., a high-profile, well-funded Event vs. a small niche Event).

### System-level risk

At the platform level, EveryX:

* Monitors **overall exposure** and cash in all pools.

* Adjusts allowed leverage when Events are very small or unbalanced.

The goal is simple:

Users can take meaningful risk and use leverage, without the platform taking on hidden liabilities it cannot cover.

# Payouts and fees

### How payouts work

After an Event Closed, resolution criteria are checked and confirmed. Once a Resolution event has occurred:

* The **correct Outcome** is identified.

* All trades on that Outcome share in the **losing pools**.

* The payout is based on:

  * how much money was in each Outcome’s pool, 

  * how big each user’s position was in the winning Outcome, and

  * how early they got involved in the outcome

Users see final results in their account as **profit or loss**.

### What are the fees?

EveryX charges a small **platform fee** from the losing side in each Event.

Key points:

* Fees are taken from the losers.

* There are **no deposit fees** from EveryX.

* No **interest** on leveraged positions.

* No complex **maker/taker** fees or funding rates.

The fee structure is intentionally simple so that KOLs, partners, and users can easily understand **how the platform earns money** and what users can expect to receive when they win.

### Event lifecycle

Each Event moves through a few clear stages:

1. **Upcoming** – Event is created, trading opens at a scheduled time.

2. **Live** – Trading is open, users can enter or adjust trades.

3. **Closed** – Trading stops before the real-world outcome is known (for example, at the start of a match or at a cutoff time).

4. **Pending Resolution** – The Event is closed, and EveryX is collecting the final information needed to decide the correct Outcome.

5. **Resolved** – The correct Outcome is confirmed, payouts are distributed.

6. **Inactive** – Event is frozen or cancelled due to external issues (e.g. data problems, ambiguity, or other unexpected events).

If an Event is cancelled or cannot be fairly resolved, EveryX has policies to **return funds** to users. Please refer to the detailed, event-specific Rules when trading.

# Accounts, deposits, and withdrawals (high-level)

### Accounts

* Opening an account on EveryX is straightforward and can be done with an email or wallet address.

* Some features (like higher withdrawal limits) may require additional verification and/or fulfilling KYC requirements.

### Deposits

* Users can deposit using supported methods (e.g. cryptocurrency, credit card, bank transfer; exact options depend on region, verification level, and current integrations).

* Deposits typically appear in moments, after network confirmation.

### Withdrawals

* Withdrawals are processed regularly, usually within a defined time window (e.g. within 24 hours).

* Maximum withdrawal amounts depend on the user’s **VIP** **level**.

* At present, EveryX **does not require excessive documentation** for standard withdrawals, but policies may depend on your jurisdiction, perceived risk level, or other factors.

* There is a $1 fee on all withdrawals to cover network costs. 

# Why EveryX? (positioning vs. other platforms)

### No market makers

On traditional order-book platforms, users mostly trade against **professional market makers** who often have:

* more information,

* faster systems,

* and incentives to profit from small edge cases.

On EveryX:

* All trades go into each Event’s **outcome pools**.

* Probabilities are set by **everyone’s money combined**, not by a special desk on the other side of your trade.

You trade against the **crowd**, not a privileged counterparty.

### Always-on liquidity for events

Because we use Event pools:

* Events do **not** require a perfect match between buyers and sellers at the exact moment of each trade.

* Money can flow into one side first (e.g. “YES”), and the other side can arrive later.

This allows EveryX to:

* Run Events that would be hard to support with a traditional order book, and

* Offer leverage even when an Event is small or niche.

### Simple, probability-first UX

EveryX hides most of the trading machinery and keeps the user focused on:

* **Probability**,

* **How much to risk**,

* **Where to place the stop-loss**.

There is no need to understand:

* order books,

* maker/taker fee tables,

* or complicated derivatives jargon.

This makes EveryX easier to explain to:

* KOLs and partners,

* non-expert users,

* and communities who are used to thinking in **chances** and **outcomes**, not candlesticks.

### Clear economics

EveryX focuses on a **single, transparent platform fee** taken from the losing side, rather than multiple overlapping fees. There are:

* No interest charges on leverage,

* No hidden funding rates,

* No complex fee ladders.
